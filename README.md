# Coffee Battle Game

This is my Ironhack's bootcamp first individual project, which consisted of creating a game using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I created a RPG Battle style game, with characters that you can choose based on your favourite coffee brewing method, to then fight against the other ones.

All the arts were made by me (except for the french and the chemex which were made by my wife lol)
